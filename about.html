        <p style="margin-left:40px; margin-right:40px">Hello people! Welcome to our website "BOOKSHELF". In this website we are showcasing books for you all.
            The main objective of our website is that it provides people with the best books on different categories such as novels, adventure and fantasy, brain teasers and psychology etc. 
We made a virtual bookshelf as an alternative to the traditional bookshelf where we display the best books so that the people who are not able to find a book for themselves can take a look on the bookshelf.
It also provides book picture and brief summary about the book.This website was made as an initiative for those who were not
able to find books for themselves.
